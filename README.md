# FLO Pay  
FLO Pay simplifies the process of verifying payments with third parties. This platform departs from the conventional monthly-based system and instead adopts a task-based approach. To maintain exceptional output quality, all performance evaluations are recorded on the blockchain, guaranteeing transparency and reliability throughout the internship journey.

In addition to making payments in Rupees, users can utilize their Rupee tokens to purchase or engage with RanchiMall's financial products, including the Exchange Market and Blockchain Bonds. It's important to note that 1 Rupee token always equals 1 INR.  

Individuals who possess Rupee tokens in their FLO blockchain address or FLO ID have the ability to convert them into Rupee cash. This conversion process is facilitated by an open and authorized network of cashiers who possess their own FLO ID.
